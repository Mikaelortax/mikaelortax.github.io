## Context

Leads were leaking between forms, inboxes, and CRM. The team needed a consistent workflow for validation and follow-up.

## Approach

I built n8n workflows with scoring, notifications, and fail-safe branches to reduce drop-off between handoffs.

## Outcome

The pipeline became more reliable and the team could prioritize high-intent opportunities sooner.
