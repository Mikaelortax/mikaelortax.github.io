## Context

Tungportalen was built to bring several operational workflows into one product surface. The main challenge was balancing reliability with day-to-day usability.

## Approach

I designed a clear information architecture and a component-driven frontend with performance as a first-class constraint. We paired that with a safer release workflow.

## Outcome

The platform improved operational control and created a solid base for future features.
