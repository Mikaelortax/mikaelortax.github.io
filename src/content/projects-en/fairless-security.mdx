## Context

Fairless Security needed a membership flow that was stable, trackable, and easy to run. The previous setup was fragmented and difficult to scale.

## Approach

The solution was structured around explicit states, automated assignments, and a lightweight operations dashboard.

## Outcome

The product became more predictable in daily operations while reducing administrative overhead.
